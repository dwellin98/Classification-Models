### ML Pokemon Project 
The aim of the project was to bulid a Machine Learning Model that will predict whether a Pokemon is legendary or not using data from the game/show Pokemon. I will be using data of all the Pokemon that has been created within the game in order to train and test my model. One restriction was that there was a limit to the amount of data as there are only so many types of Pokemon.

A second part of the Pokemon project was to create a recommendation engine based on a Pokemon type what other types of Pokemon would that user like based on their attributes and similarities. The motivation behind this project is that it will provide insight into what categories are most correlated with each other.

### Problem statement
As a fan of Pokemon I always found it difficult to know what Pokemon are truly the strongest and what makes a Pokemon Legendary. The recommendation system is to create a new system that I have no seen before when using the game, futhermore my personal movtivation and nostalgia as my favourite type of Pokemon was Water and I wanted to see if the model will suggest a type of Pokemon type I like and would agree with.

### Data description
#### Name

* The name of the Pokemon. Data Type: String

#### Type 1

* The type of Pokemon, all Pokemon have a type 1 category. This feature helps describe the Pokemon's attributes.

#### Type 2

* The type 2 is for Pokemon who are of two types. Not all Pokemon are of two types however this provides a further understanding of the Pokemons attributes.

#### HP, Attack, Defense,SP.Atk, Speed

* This features are used to describe the Pokemons physical abilities and special powers that a Pokemon has which varies on a Pokemon by Pokemon basis.

#### Generation

* This feature categorises the Pokemon by cohort which is dependent on when the Pokemon were releases in the game and added to the database.

#### Legendary

* This is boolean feature that catgorises whether a Pokemon is rare of type this is due to their Type and specfic attributes that they retain.
